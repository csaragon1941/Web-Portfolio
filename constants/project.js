With a clear objective in mind, I set out to create a practical application, and I chose to collaborate with Alpha Chi Omega, my sorority, leveraging my deep understanding of the organization and identifying areas where technology could make a significant impact.",
          "To ensure a robust foundation, we meticulously documented our progress, crafting formal Business Requirement Specifications (BRS) and System Requirement Specifications (SRS) tailored specifically for our esteemed sponsor. By closely engaging with stakeholders, our aim was to develop an intuitive, efficient, and visually captivating app that would address the existing application's limitations. To approach writing, interviews, and requirements gathering comprehensively and efficiently, I skillfully incorporated the Elder Paul Model and other pertinent resources.While coding wasn't the focus of this project, I presented Alpha Chi Omega with a wireframe illustrating a potential user experience (UX) design that could be implemented during the production phase. My primary focus was on delivering top-notch outputs, relying heavily on critical thinking throughout the entire process.",
